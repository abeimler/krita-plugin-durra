[size=200][b]An h1 header[/b][/size]
Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. [i]Italic[/i], [b]bold[/b], and monospace. Itemized lists
look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.

[quote]Block quotes are
written like so.[/quote]
>
[quote]They can span multiple paragraphs,
if you like.[/quote]

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all
in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.
Unicode is supported. â˜º



[size=100][b]An h2 header[/b][/size]
Here's a numbered list:

 1. first item
 2. second item
 3. third item

Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
from the left side). Here's a code sample:

[code]# Let me re-iterate ...
for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }[/code]

As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:

~~~
define foobar() {
[code]print "Welcome to flavor country!";[/code]
}
~~~

(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the
delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:

~~~python
import time
[size=200][b]Quick, count to ten![/b][/size]
for i in range(10):
[code]# (but not *too* quick)
time.sleep(0.5)
print(i)[/code]
~~~



[b]An h3 header[/b]

Now a nested list:

 1. First, get these ingredients:

[code]  * carrots
  * celery
  * lentils[/code]

 2. Boil some water.

 3. Dump everything in the pot and follow
[code]this algorithm:[/code]

[code]    find wooden spoon
    uncover pot
    stir
    cover pot
    balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
    wait 10 minutes
    goto first step (or shut off burner when done)[/code]

[code]Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.[/code]

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including
that last line which continues item 3 above).

Here's a link to [url=http://foo.bar]a website[/url], to a [local
doc](local-doc.html), and to a [section heading in the current
doc](#an-h2-header). Here's a footnote [^1].



Tables can look like this:

Name           Size  Material      Color
------------- -----  ------------  ------------
All Business      9  leather       brown
Roundabout       10  hemp canvas   natural
Cinderella       11  glass         transparent

Table: Shoes sizes, materials, and colors.

(The above is the caption for the table.) Pandoc also supports
multi-line tables:

--------  -----------------------
Keyword   Text
--------  -----------------------
red       Sunsets, apples, and
[code]      other red or reddish
      things.[/code]

green     Leaves, grass, frogs
[code]      and other things it's
      not easy being.[/code]
--------  -----------------------

A horizontal rule follows.

***

Here's a definition list:

apples
  : Good for making applesauce.

oranges
  : Citrus!

tomatoes
  : There's no "e" in tomatoe.

Again, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between each
term and  its definition to spread things out more.)

Here's a "line block" (note how whitespace is honored):

| Line one
|   Line too
| Line tree

and images can be specified like so:

![url=example-image.jpg "An exemplary image"]example image[/url]

Inline math equation: $\omega = d\phi / dt$. Display
math should get its own line like so:

$$I = \int \rho R^{2} dV$$

And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters
which you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: \foo\, \[i]bar\[/i], etc.
